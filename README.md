# IP_NOVA_Project
To create project for intro to programming class

Remember to check for outliers
use statsmodels to perform logistic regression and print summary

When skewed distribution boders the model ?????
For which models should we scale the data? (for sure KNN, regression, anything else?)
Should we scale binary variables?

TO DO LIST
1. ploting data for outliers and errors (30-50line) - Dominika
2. bivariable comparison ! -> plot few graphs in one display (115line) - Dominika 
3. heat map for correlation - Lukas
4. specifing columns for pairplot(125) - Lukas
5. creating formula to measure qualities - Lukas
6. summary for different regression models - Pedro
7. Do the logistic regression with and without PCA  somehow compare those - Lukas
7.5 Do the logistic regression with and without LDA - Pedro
8. Plot decision trees, - Lukas
9. For random forest plot error graph and ROC courve - Konrad
