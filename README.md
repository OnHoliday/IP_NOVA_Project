Binary classification problem for chrun prediction.

Remember to check for outliers
use statsmodels to perform logistic regression and print summary

When skewed distribution boders the model ?????
For which models should we scale the data? (for sure KNN, regression, anything else?)
Should we scale binary variables?

TO DO LIST
3. heat map for correlation - Lukas pending
6. summary for different regression models - Pedro PENDING
7.5 Do the logistic regression with and without LDA - Pedro pednding
8. Plot decision trees, - Konrad pending 



Report:
Introductino: Lukas
Data Descriptons: Konrad/Dominika
Refrences - Pedro (all of us have to send input from where we have our knowledge)


Introductino: 300
Data Descriptons: 600
Data preprocessing: 300
Modling: 1000  -> everyone describe his own model -> why we chose that one, general idea behind model, 
Model selection: 400 -> explain k fold crossvalidation + model graph
Selected model Tuning: 100 explain what grid search does
Conclusion: 300


TO DO 12/11
-put some coments to explain what is happening in visualizatino section ( a lot of graph dont have comments and how to execute them in what order)
-make corssvalidation for every model happend
